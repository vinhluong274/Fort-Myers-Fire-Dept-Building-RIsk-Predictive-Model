This data starts at 1 January 2008 and ends at 20 February 2019. The dataset contains 17,465 observations. Each row is an incident. An incident is a single event such as a motor vehicle collission at First and Main streets. Sent to this MVC at First and Main streets can be two fire apppartus, two police squad cars to direct traffic and issue a ticket, and three ambulances to transport the three patients who are hurt to the hospital. These are counted as seven responses to this single incident. 

The data provided  does not contain information on how many responses occured. Only the singular incident.

The first one is Lee County proprietary system where we created our own incident type designations. The second schema is from the FPDS or MPDS: Fire and Medical Priority Dispatch System. Within the MPDS / FPDS there is an integer and then a letter (A, O, B, C, D, E). The A is very low priority. The O is like saying 'get to it when you have nothing else to do'. The B and the C are middle priority. The D and the E are high priority and immediate priority.
